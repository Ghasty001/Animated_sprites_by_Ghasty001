# Animated Sprites by Ghasty001
A repository with all animated sprites I made on official pokemon, who usually currently miss on Smogon's sprite project when I needed them, or just made for fun.

All these sprites are free to use, for other projects to use *with credit*. The credits also apply to all the artists who made the base sprite I used for the animation (also shared with free to use consense), and all of them will be listed below.

This repository will be updated progressively when I make a new animation. The choice of the species itself is purely based on my personal will, and no requests are accepted.

Lastly, if I don't make the front/back for a specific sprite, is because I either haven't done it yet, or found a perfectly fine animation made by a talented artist. In the latter case, I'll also include these in the credits.

Enjoy.
